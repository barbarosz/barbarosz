## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am Barbaros â€” a curious, relentless computer science student from Turkiye, currently building my future in the U.S. through code, community, and caffeine. Whether Iâ€™m crafting custom data structures in C++, mentoring students as ACM chapter president, or preparing for my next big leap (yes, Google is the goal), Iâ€™m always in motion.

Youâ€™ll find me deep in debugging sessions one day, and leading a tech workshop or hackathon the next. I thrive at the intersection of engineering and leadership â€” solving real problems, uplifting peers, and navigating every opportunity with the mindset of someone whoâ€™s here to stay, grow, and make an impact.

-  I will be interning at Discovery Partners Institute â€” diving into data-driven product management, Python pipelines, and product strategy. Some days Iâ€™ll be analyzing YouTube Trends, other days pitching insights like itâ€™s a startup boardroom.
- ðŸ“œ I will graduate in May 2027 from Virginia Tech
- ðŸŽ² I navigate between code and creativity â€” building games, designing interfaces, analyzing data, and growing communities. If it involves solving problems or creating something people love to use, Iâ€™m all in.
- ðŸ‘” Iâ€™m an ambassador for the World Business Chicago ThinkChicago program.
- ðŸ’» I served as President of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Wilbur Wright College Chapter.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
